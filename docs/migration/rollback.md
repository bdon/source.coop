# Rollback Plan

This document outlines the procedures for rolling back the DynamoDB migration if issues occur.

## Overview

The rollback plan ensures we can quickly revert to the old schema if any issues are encountered during or after the migration.

## Rollback Triggers

Rollback should be initiated if any of the following occur:
1. Data loss or corruption detected
2. Application errors after migration
3. Performance degradation
4. User-reported issues
5. Validation failures

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Immediate Actions

1. Stop the application
2. Notify users of issues
3. Begin rollback process

### 2. Database Rollback

```bash
# Delete new tables
npx tsx scripts/migration/rollback.ts

# Verify old tables are still intact
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name sc-accounts
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name sc-repositories
```

### 3. Application Rollback

1. Revert application configuration:
```bash
# Restore old environment variables
cp .env.backup .env

# Revert code changes
git checkout <pre-migration-commit>
```

2. Restart application with old configuration

### 4. Verification

1. Verify application functionality
2. Check data access
3. Monitor error rates
4. Test user workflows

## Rollback Timeline

| Step | Duration | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Stop Application | 5 minutes | Graceful shutdown |
| Database Rollback | 5 minutes | Delete new tables |
| Application Rollback | 10 minutes | Revert configuration |
| Verification | 15 minutes | Test functionality |
| Total | 35 minutes | Complete rollback |

## Data Preservation

### 1. Backup Strategy
- Keep old tables for 1 week
- Maintain export backups
- Document all changes

### 2. Data Recovery
If needed, we can recover data from:
- Point-in-time exports
- S3 backups
- Old table snapshots

## Communication Plan

### 1. Internal Communication
- Notify development team
- Alert operations team
- Update status page

### 2. User Communication
- Post maintenance update
- Provide status updates
- Share expected resolution time

## Post-Rollback Tasks

### 1. Investigation
- Document issues encountered
- Analyze root causes
- Plan fixes

### 2. Cleanup
- Remove temporary files
- Clean up logs
- Update documentation

### 3. Future Planning
- Schedule new migration attempt
- Update migration plan
- Address identified issues

## Success Criteria

Rollback is considered successful when:
1. Application is running with old schema
2. All data is accessible
3. No data loss occurred
4. Users can use the system normally
5. Performance is restored
6. Error rates are normal
