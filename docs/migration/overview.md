# Migration Overview and Planning

## Phase 1: Local Development

### 1.1 Local Environment Setup
1. Update local DynamoDB schema
2. Update application code to work with new schema
3. Update type definitions
4. Run and fix all tests
5. Manual testing of all features

### 1.2 Validation
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] All features working as expected
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] No regressions in functionality

## Phase 2: Production Preparation

### 2.1 Backup Current Data
```bash
# Export current tables
aws dynamodb export-table-to-point-in-time \
    --table-name sc-accounts \
    --s3-bucket radiant-assets \
    --export-time $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

aws dynamodb export-table-to-point-in-time \
    --table-name sc-repositories \
    --s3-bucket radiant-assets \
    --export-time $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
```

### 2.2 Migration Script Development
1. Create data transformation scripts
2. Test scripts against backup data
3. Validate transformed data
4. Create rollback procedures

## Phase 3: Production Migration

### 3.1 Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Local environment fully tested
- [ ] Backup current tables
- [ ] Migration scripts tested against backup data
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window

### 3.2 Deployment Steps
1. Schedule maintenance window
2. Stop application
3. Run final backup
4. Execute migration
5. Validate data
6. Start application with new code
7. Monitor for issues

## Phase 4: Post-Migration

### 4.1 Monitoring
- Application performance
- Error rates
- Database metrics
- User feedback

### 4.2 Cleanup
- Keep old backup data for 1 week
- Update documentation
- Archive migration scripts

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks
1. Data loss during migration
2. Application downtime
3. Performance degradation
4. Data inconsistency

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive backups
2. Local testing first
3. Rollback plan
4. Validation procedures

## Success Criteria

1. Local environment fully tested
2. All data successfully migrated
3. No data loss or corruption
4. Application functioning normally
5. Performance metrics within acceptable range
6. No user-reported issues
7. All tests passing

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Local Development | 3-4 days | Schema updates and testing |
| Production Preparation | 1-2 days | Backup and script development |
| Testing | 2 days | Comprehensive testing |
| Deployment | 1 day | Production deployment |
| Monitoring | 1 week | Post-deployment monitoring |
| Cleanup | 1 day | Final cleanup |

Total: ~2-3 weeks

## Next Steps

1. Review [Schema Changes](./schema-changes.md)
2. Update local DynamoDB schema
3. Update application code
4. Begin local testing process
